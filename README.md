This section record something about my studying blockchain, I will used TypeScript to develop GuGua.

Day 1: I set up the node and TypeScript environment.

Day 2: I tested a simple blockchain example: block and chain.

From now on..., I will also put this section in blockchain to record my daily work on this project, refer to
`blockchain/record.ts`.
